# Indoor Location Emulator For Machine Learning Models  

The indoor-location-emulator is a project that was designed to compile and provide a set of synthetic data from a simulated environment that would allow for the application, study, and evaluation of a set of real characteristic factors, and that would allow for the creation of real automatic learning models in the future, using Machine Learning techniques, to be applied in a context of asset localization and prediction, in an indoor environment, using passive RFID tags and the RSSI values obtained from RF antennas.

## Main Modules:
Inside the src directory are disposed the main modules:
- frontend: This module includes the frontend processing of Indoor Location Emulator and Tracking (using Mapbox GL JS) [Developed with HTML, Vanilla Javascript & CSS].
- backend: That module includes the backend processing of Indoor Location Emulator [Developed in Python].
- ml-models: This module includes Machine Learning scripts [Developed in Python]. 
- static-files: This module includes the Static Files objects used in Emulation .

## Documentantion 

Documentation was created individually for each module and aggregated into that page that is served on GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://atnog.github.io/indoor-location-emulator/).
